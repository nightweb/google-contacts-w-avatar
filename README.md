Warning
===
This is still a work in progress. The API for modifying elements will be cleaned up to remove the need for hackish data management for updating elements, everything else should be final.

Overview
===
Reduces the complexity for dealing with importing and exporting using the [Google Contacts v3](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/) && [Google Contacts v2](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v2/) API. Handles preserving the existing data and modifying any new data added without having to deal with it yourself. Supports with photo (avatar) management.
Based on original gem google-contacts. See https://github.com/Placester/google-contacts
